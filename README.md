This repository contains the code for the algorithm proposed in the paper Designing Parity Preserving Reversible Circuits

Given a reversible or an irreversible specification the code converts into a parity preserving reversible specification in a manner that minimizes the number ofgarbage lines

The format of the output can be modified as per the input requirements of the synthesis tools like revsyn

A sample input and output file has been add in the tests folder

The format of the input file is as under
The first line contains the number of variables (2 in the file tests/in1.txt)
It is followed by atmost 2^n lines
These 2^n lines are the decimal representation of the mappings of the file.

For example if the circuit specification(Table 1 in the above mentioned paper) is as under:
00    00
01    10
10    10
11    01

Then the first line of the input file will be 2 as the number of input variables is 2
The first line is followed by
0
2
2
1
which are the decimal representations of the output mappings 00(0), 10(2), 10(2), 01(1)

The output generated by the code is as under

No. of garbage bits : 2
Input   ||  Output
00  00  ||  00 00  0
01  00  ||  10 00  0
10  00  ||  10 01  1
11  00  ||  01 00  1

It generated a reversible mapping along with preserving the parity
